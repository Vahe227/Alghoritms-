// The solution to this problem is under development because this solution is not effective in all cases.

// Problem

// You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

// Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

// Example 1:

// Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
// Output: true
// Example 2:

// Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
// Output: false

// How I Solve This Problem

// Flowerbed Placement Problem
// For this problem, the solution begins by checking whether the target location in the flowerbed is empty (represented by 0). If it is, the algorithm further verifies that 
// the adjacent positions are also empty (not 1), as the problem statement specifies that no two flowers can be planted next to each other.If these conditions are satisfied, 
// the function returns true.In all other cases, it returns false.The time complexity of this approach is O(1), which is highly efficient since it performs a constant number 
// of operations regardless of the input size.The problem is still under development, as the current solution does not handle all scenarios correctly.
